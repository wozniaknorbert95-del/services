# Agent card sample (anonymised)

## Why agent cards matter

A multi-agent system without contracts drifts fast. Each agent gets:
- a **single role** (no mega-agent),
- **least-privilege tools** (only what the task needs),
- a **clear output** (plan, diff, test report, sign-off request, handoff).

This sample mirrors the live 5-node LangGraph pipeline — names anonymised.

## Sample cards (LangGraph pipeline)

| Agent | Core role | Allowed scope | Typical output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Planner** | Break work into atomic tasks | Read SSoT docs, task list | Implementation plan + file list |
| **Coder** | Implement one module per session | Target folder only, git diff | Working code in test environment |
| **Tester** | Verify behaviour & regressions | Test scripts, read logs | Pass/fail report with reproduction steps |
| **Reviewer** | Human gate (HITL) | Approve / reject / cancel | Signed-off diff or blocked deploy |
| **Summarizer** | Session closure | Handoff + session notes | Handoff markdown on disk |

**Pipeline:** `Planner → Coder → Tester → Reviewer → Summarizer` — fixed order, no skipped steps.

---

## What each agent cannot do

- **Planner** cannot deploy to production or edit live customer data.
- **Coder** cannot change global business rules without schema approval.
- **Tester** cannot bypass failing checks.
- **Reviewer** is not optional on production paths — deploy stays manual by design.
- **Summarizer** does not auto-deploy — handoff only.

---

## Hybrid honesty

- **VPS (LIVE):** orchestration, queue, HITL, Mission Control, Langfuse.
- **Local runner (LOCAL-ONLY):** code/git execution on dev PC — tasks wait in `WAITING_RUNNER` when PC is offline.
- **VCMS** governs repos and SSoT — outside the LangGraph pipeline.

---

## Stack (process proof)

- **Control plane:** FastAPI + LangGraph + PostgreSQL on EU VPS
- **UI:** Mission Control (agent-os-ui) — tasks, queue, history, costs
- **Measurement:** prod smoke PASS — architecture diagram and 60s demo on case study
